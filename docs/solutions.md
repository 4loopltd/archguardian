# The Solution

ArchGuardian introduces a new concept:  
**a per‑repository micro‑model that evolves with your codebase.**

This model:

- Lives inside the repository
- Learns from every PR
- Rebuilds itself on a schedule
- Understands your architecture and patterns
- Exposes a clean API for any AI agent
- Acts as an AI architectural linter

ArchGuardian gives your project a persistent architectural memory - something no existing AI tool provides.
