# The Problem

Modern software development is facing a new kind of technical debt: **AI‑accelerated architectural drift**.

AI tools generate code quickly, but they lack persistent, project‑specific context. This leads to:

- Inconsistent patterns
- Duplicate logic
- Loss of architectural intent
- Developers over‑rely on AI
- Code reviews overloaded with pattern policing
- Legacy codebases are becoming harder to navigate
- AI‑generated code that “works” but doesn’t *fit*

As AI adoption increases, these problems compound.  
ArchGuardian exists to solve them.
